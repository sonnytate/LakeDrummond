Masonic Home of Virginia
2011 Masonic Village Fee Schedule

Situated in the midst of ninety beautiful acres at 4101 Nine Mile Road in Richmond, the
Masonic Village awaits Masons and their families. Wonderfully maintained and reasonably priced, the cost of living in the Village is comprised of two parts, an up-front, one-time entrance fee and a continuing monthly fee. Two fee plans are available, as outlined below. Plan A is designed for applicants who can pay a higher entrance fee and desire a lower monthly cost. Plan B requires a smaller initial payment (Entrance Fee) but costs more each month during the resident’s entire stay. Upon admission to the Village, each applicant selects a payment plan. Because each payment plan is unique, residents cannot change payment plans after admission.

Entrance Fee
Entrance fees are established annually and can vary slightly according to the floor plan. Ninety percent (90%) of this fee is refundable on a prorated basis over the five years following admission.

Monthly Fees
In addition to the Entrance Fee, monthly fees are paid by each resident and are adjusted annually.
