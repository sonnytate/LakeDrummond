Our Grand Master, Most Worshipful Joim M. Chambliss, Jr. has authorized this letter to be sent to
selected Lodges and Districts which have historically sponsored the majority of residents to the Masonic
Home of Virginia.

By this letter, we are sharing some exciting news of a new pricing opportunity in our Village cottages.
Also, we will be hosting an OPEN HOUSE on Saturday. May 2L 2011 from 1:00 -4:00 PM.

If possible, please provide copies of the enclosed information to as many of your members as possible.
Please use mail, bulletin boards and any electronic methods you may find effective.

The enclosed information concerns the cottages available, which are designed for Masons and their
relatives who can and desire to live independently, but who also welcome the advantages of living on the grounds of the Masonic Home. We now offer TWO fee plans, one with a larger initial cost and lower
monthly fees and a new alternative plan that allows a much lower entrance fee, in exchange for higher
monthly fees.

Please share this information with Brethren who regularly attend your meetings, but perhaps more
especially to those Brethren and Masonic Widows who cannot regularly attend. We would love to see
members  of every Lodge attend the OPEN HOUSE on May 2 1 . Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
Your time invested in this effort might well fulfill our Grand Master’s theme and Make A Dfference in
some Brother’s life.

Sincerely and fraternally,
James D. Cole, PGM, CPA
Chief Executive Officer
