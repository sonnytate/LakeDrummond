            <p>
                Realizing that the youth of today will be the future of tomorrow, the purpose of this 
                scholarship is to assist with the continued education and further development of those potential leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lake Drummond Masonic Lodge will make available two (2) $1000.00 college scholarships 
                to immediate family members of Lake Drummond Lodge.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purpose of this scholarship, immediate family members shall be described as:

                <li>Grandchildren</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Lodge Master shall appoint a scholarship committee, consisting of not less than 3, nor more than 5 members, 
                of the lodge members to review all applications and make the final decision regarding those selected.
                If there are less than two (2) applications received, it shall be the decision of the Lake Drummond Lodge Board 
                of Directors whether to increase the amount to the maximum $2,000.00 originally budgeted.
                In the case of no applications being received, the budgeted monies shall remain in the lodge account and be 
                delegated to the Building Fund.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an effort to assist the majority of the membership, once this scholarship has been awarded to an applicant, 
                that applicant is no longer eligible for future Lake Drummond Lodge scholarships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blank applications will be made available at the January Stated Communications and must be postmarked and returned 
                to the Committee Chairman no later than the date specified on the application. Once the application date has passed, 
                the Chairman shall contact his committee and begin the selection process. After the process has been completed, 
                the Chairman shall notify the Master of the Lodge in order that the names of the recipients be announced at the May 
                Stated Communications. The applicants selected will then be notified by mail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those applicants not selected will receive notice of regret and encouraged to reapply the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the nature of college choices often being changed, it will be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the 
                Lodge Treasurer of his/her final decision. Once notification has been made, the Lodge Treasurer shall issue a check in 
                the name of the college and the applicant and delivered to the applicant.
