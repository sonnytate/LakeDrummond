  <p>Brethren and friends,    </p>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit the web supplement of the Master's message.  The year has been progressing quite well thus far.  We have had above average attendance at out communications, we have also had a lot of interest from Brethren to become more active.  Lake Drummond Lodge needs your support to truly flourish.  The Lodge is a living thing and cannot survive without the help of it members. We have Raised our first Master Mason of 2009, Bro. Jason Scott Roberson, congratulations Jason!!  We look forward to raising many more Master Mason this year at Lake Drummond.    </p>
  <p>There are quite a few activities upcoming for Lake Drummond Lodge.  As soon as the weather improves will begin some community support activities.  Keep your eye out for more information.  If you know of any Brother, Widow, or member of the community in general in need of support please let the Lodge know.  We will be receiving the District Deputy Grand Master on his Official Visit on our March Stated, Thursday the 12th.  The District Education Leadership Conference will be held on Saturday, March 7 at the Newport News Scottish Rite Building.  All Master Masons are encouraged to attend.    </p>
  <p>Please keep our sick and distressed Brethren, and their families, in your thoughts and Prayers.  the miraculous works of God are paramount and without Prayer the world would be a dark and dreary place indeed.  While it is true that Prayer is a powerful thing, sometimes it takes a visit or even a phone call to sick Brother to remind him that we are thinking about him.  I know this will truly bring a smile to their face and make the day a little brighter.  You can contact our Sick Committee Chairman Wor. Elmer Walters or myself for information on the sick.    </p>
  <p>A special thank you to our Trustees for keeping our Temple in such great shape, keep up the good work.  The trustees recently installed compact fluorescent light bulbs in the Lodge room in an effort to save energy.  Lake Drummond Lodge is doing it's part to conserve energy, are you doing yours?    </p>
  <p>A reminder that our building and facilities are available for rent to our members, contact the Worshipful Master or any Lodge Trustee for information.  
    
    In an effort to usher Lake Drummond into the 21st century, we will be going digital.  You will see regular updates on the website, often thing that will not fit into the Trestleboard.  </p>
  <p>In an effort to save the Lodge money, the Trestleboard will only be mailed out every three months.  In order to keep the members in the loop, you are encouraged to sign up to receive a digital copy via email.  Periodic updates and special communications will be transmitted once your email address is on file.  Please contact Bro. Sonny Tate at lakedrummond@sonnytate.com or Wor. Kyle W. Strickland at strklnd003@aol.com with your email address.    </p>
  <p>On a side note, to those involved with Appendant bodies, please get out and support them.  The Royal Arch Chapter, Allied Masonic Degrees, Order of the Eastern Star and Jobies all meet here at Lake Drummond and their meeting times are noted in the schedule.  Our youth organizations are of special interest.  The International Order of Job's Daughters Bethel 11 is a great organization for young ladies.  Their meetings are open to all Master Masons and they are truly touched when they have visitors from the Lodge.  Melinda Russell is the Bethel Guardian, and she can be contacted for any additional information.    </p>
  <p>I look forward to seeing everyone at Lodge soon and often.  Thank you for your continued help and support, and if there is anything I can do to be of assistance to you, please let me know.  This section of the web site will be updated often, please check back regularly to this page as well as the rest of the site for updates.  As always may God Bless you and keep you, and may all your good intentions be crowned with success.    </p>
  <p>Sincerely and Fraternally,    </p>
  <p>Kyle W. Strickland </p>
