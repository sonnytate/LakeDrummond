    <div class="east">
        <p>Brethren,</p>
        <p>My, how  swiftly, run the sands of time. It is  hard to imagine that a quarter of the year has come and gone. I would like to thank everyone for their hard  work and dedication thus far.  As well as  those who do so much behind the scenes, and rarely take credit for their worthwhile  efforts. Your support of me, the  Officers and Lake Drummond Lodge in particular is astounding, and I am truly  grateful.</p>
        <p>We have raised our first Brother of the year, Bro. Jason S.  Roberson, as well as initiated one.  Congratulations to Jason, and we hope to Raise our new Entered  Apprentice soon, as well as those who are working so diligently on their  catechisms. We have started implementing  our Mentor Program, thanks to Worshipful Brothers Buddy Whittington and Bill  Manier, as well as other Past Master and Officers, keep the input coming  in. Like I have stated before, the  Mentor Program is not intended to replace the catechism coach but to add another  tool to help retain active members.</p>
        <p>
            The first quarter of the year has been extremely busy; our  March Stated (DDGM Official Visit) had over 75 Brethren in attendance, we also  saw our two newest 50 and 25 year Masonic Veterans, Brothers Kenneth E.  Stephens, Sr. and Guy Walters, respectively.  Things are heating up at Lake Drummond Lodge, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time  you came to Lodge to see what the fuss is all about.

Please come out and support this wonderful  event, enjoy the great food and the even better fellowship. Thanks to Worshipful Kenny and Brothers Tim  and Norman Strickland for heading up this great and important undertaking. . If  you haven&rsquo;t been to a Lodge meeting lately this may be the sparked needed to  excite your curiosity once again, as well as the opportunity to see some old  friends and Brothers.

            APPLICATIONS FOR LAKE DRUMMOND&#8217;S 2009 SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS
            <br />
            DATE DUE - APRIL 1, 2009
        </p>
        <p>
            On the recommendation of the Scholarship Committee and with the approval of the Worshipful Master of Lake Drummond Lodge,
	the deadline for receiving applications for the Scholarship Fund has been changed to April 1. Previously the deadline had been
	June 1. The change was made primarily to enable the recipient of the scholarship to have their name printed in the graduation
	program as having received a scholarship from Lake Drummond Lodge No. 178. Also, the change in date will enable the committee
	to make a decision in a timely manner. This will ensure that the recipient can be recognized in lodge with his/her parents before
	they have left for college. Nothing else has changed. The new application form is available from the Lodge secretary or from Ray
	Lowery, chairman of the scholarship committee.
