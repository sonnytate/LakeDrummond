    <!--- From the east --->
    <div class="east">
        <p>Brethren,</p>
        <p>
            First off, I would like to thank you for electing me to serve as your Worshipful
	Master for 2009. A special thank you to all those, too numerous to list, who
	have helped and supported me through this endeavor. To my family, words
	cannot express the gratitude I feel towards you. Without you, I would have
	never been able to come so far, both in masonry and life. Lake Drummond
	Lodge means a great deal to me and so do all of you brethren. I will do my
	best to make this year great and I will look forward to seeing you all in Lodge
	soon and often.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many projects in store for 2009, some continued and some new.
	My theme this year is &#8220;Letting Our Light Shine.&#8221; Freemasonry is the greatest
	organization in the world, and it is time we further demonstrated this, more
	especially to our community. This task will only be successful with your
	continued support and dedication. The Past Masters of Lake Drummond
	Lodge are truly the backbone of Freemasonry. Their wisdom knows no bounds.
	However, one must heed their advice and be ready to act. The next generation
	needs to be willing and able to take the torch as it is passed. Therefore, I
	have established a mentoring and membership retention committee. This
	committee will mentor new brethren, as well as all members, in order to
	further define Lake Drummond Lodge as one of the shining lights in Virginia
	Freemasonry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am by no means willing to solicit new members, but I believe with the proper
	tools in place, we can, not only attract hard working men of moral fortitude,
	who wish to better themselves and this community, but also retain them. It
	is your responsibility to guide these men down the path of Freemasonry and
	help them achieve their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a side note, to those involved with Appendant bodies, please get out
	and support them. This Royal Arch Chapter, Allied Masonic Degrees, Order
	134TH YEAR January /February /March 2009 VOL. 36, NO. 1
	of the Eastern Star and Jobies all meet here at Lake Drummond and their
	meeting times are noted in the schedule. Our youth organizations are of
	special interest. The International Order of Job&#8217;s Daughters Bethel 11 is a
	great organization for young ladies. Their meetings are open to all Master
	Masons and they are truly touched when they have visitors from the Lodge.
	Melinda Russell is the Bethel Guardian and she can be contacted for any
	additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, thank you again for allowing me to serve Lake Drummond and I
	look forward to seeing all of you in the year to come. Be proud of Masonry
	in general, more especially of the wonderful Lodge of which you are the
	lifeblood. Assist me in letting our light shine in 2009. God bless all of you
	and may all of your good intentions be crowned with success.
	Sincerely and Fraternally
        </p>
